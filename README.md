## Project Overview
In this project I was given a static webpage and tasked with adding in accessibility, and a responsive design so the page could be used on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker for caching the application for offline use.

## Steps Required To Run Application
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and explore the webpage.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). This repository of the project already has my Mapbox token within the code so the program will run without any additional steps needing to be taken.
